          <h2>Local Storage Vs. Session Storage</h2>
          <p>
            SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ;  The difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

            programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a 
            few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
